        <p>You are the captain of a spaceship named "The Flying Hippo." One day, you're working on tuning up your ship's engines when you get an urgent message on your space phone:</p>
        <p>"Captain, one of our Mars robots is sick. We need you to go to Mars immediately and retrieve it so that we can fix it and download the results of its important experiments."</p>
        <p>You remember that you're supposed to go to a meeting of the Space Scouts tonight, and you were really looking forward to it. But, on the other hand, the other Space Scouts would understand that this mission is very important.</p>
        <p>What do you do? Go to Mars, or stay home?If I decide to go,but then who's gonna take care off my cat & on the other hand I promised the gents(Space Scouts) that i would attend the meeting.</p>

    <div class="storyPart" id="answer02">
        <p>Answer Yes when you're ready!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="err0">
        <p>Please answer yes or no.</p>
        <p>Yes;I'II fly and go there(Mars) but when I come back,I hope the are no funny businesses about sending me aboard without me knowing beforehand.</p>
        <p>And as I'll be gone for your duties then I really need someone to take care of house'businesses and other responsibilities that side.</p>

    <div class="storyPart" id="answer11">
        <p>Great choice! Mars is lovely this time of year (or, during the time of the year when you'll arrive, about 260 days from now!).</p>
        <p>You pack up your things and prepare enough food for the journey, then take off!</p>
        <p>Launch goes smoothly and you sit back, put on your headphones, and prepare for a relaxing trip.</p>
        <p>A week later, things are going great. There's nothing for you to do except read, listen to music, and watch movies. Just then, you hear a strange sound.</p>
        <p>"meow."</p>
        <p>It sounds like Gizmo, your cat! She must have snuck aboard while you were packing!</p>
        <p>You're happy to have the company, but you didn't pack enough food for the both of you, and there certainly isn't a grocery store on the way to Mars.</p>
        <p>You have a choice: risk running out of food on the return trip, or turn around now and go home. What will you do?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer12">
        <p>You decide to stay home. They'll get someone else to fly to Mars. Besides, you heard that they're going to have free pizza at the Space Scouts meeting!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="err1">
        <p>Please answer Mars or Earth.</p>
        <p>I'II take the risk and my lovely place called earth and go seal the deal off in Mars.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer21">
        <p>You decide to risk it. The journey is long, and you give sweet Gizmo half your food, knowing that you may not survive the return trip, but the Flying Hippo can carry the robot home without you, and at least the important experimental data (and
            Gizmo, of course) will be safe.</p>
        <p>When you arrive at Mars, you quickly locate the sick robot. But, you also discover something else: a large ice chest full of delicious sandwiches! The last repair crew to visit the robot must have left this here! You unwrap one of the sandwiches
            and carefully take a bite. Peanut butter! Your favorite! Gizmo's favorite too!</p>
        <p>You pack up the sandwiches and the sick robot and begin the trip home, knowing that there's now more than enough food for both you and Gizmo.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer22">
        <p>Let someone else get the robot. You turn the Flying Hippo around and head home.</p>
        <p>When you get back to the spaceport, you open the door to exit your spaceship and your boss is standing outside.</p>
        <p>You apologize and explain the whole thing to him about how there wouldn't have been enough food.</p>
        <p>He says he'll send someone else and that you'll have </p>
        <p>Oh well, at least you still have Gizmo!</p>

    <div class="storyPart" id="answer31">
        <p>You realise that the isn't going to be enough food for you and Gizmo</p>
        <p>And you do realise that you have to eat and Gizmo's the only snack that you be left with so you got to eat,but you're considering this since he's your favorite pet.</p>
        <p>You say your last words to Gizmo since you're considering of eating him and set up the fire.</p>
        <p>On your way back you made the boss proud and you made him aware of the sacrifices that you did,and he promised to reward you with a higher title</p>
